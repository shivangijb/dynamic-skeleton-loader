# Dynamic Skeleton Loader

In this project, I have created a simple dynamic skeleton loader using css. This loader can be integrated with any component easily. A dropdown is provided to select the shape (rectangle or circle) of image component. This image component uses the same skeleton loader. 
## What are skeleton loaders ?
A skeleton loader, also known skeleton UI or content placeholder, is a design pattern used in user interfaces to provide users with visual feedback while content is being loaded. It consists of a simplified version of the layout or structure of the page or component being loaded, typically represented by empty boxes or lines that resemble the actual content's layout.

1. Placeholder Structure: Skeleton loaders mimic the structure of the content being loaded, including its layout, dimensions, and basic styling. This helps users understand where content will appear once it's loaded.

2. Visual Feedback: By displaying a skeleton loader, users receive immediate visual feedback that the application is working on loading content, reducing the perception of loading times and providing a more seamless user experience.

3. Progress Indication: Skeleton loaders can also serve as a progress indicator, showing users that content is loading gradually. As content loads, the skeleton structure is gradually replaced with actual content.

4. User Engagement: Maintaining user engagement during loading times is crucial for retaining users' attention. Skeleton loaders help prevent users from feeling like the application is unresponsive or slow by providing a sense of progress and continuity.

5. Implementation: Skeleton loaders can be implemented using HTML and CSS to create placeholder elements that resemble the content's layout. They can also be implemented dynamically using JavaScript frameworks to generate skeleton structures based on the expected content.

Overall, skeleton loaders play an essential role in improving the perceived performance and user experience of web and mobile applications by providing visual feedback and maintaining user engagement during loading times.
